•	Allow a quick and easy dissemination of game data.
(updated)
•	Due to time constraints the objects have been simplified.
•	Allow anyone to track the score of game.
•	Allow quick editing of the score.

PROJECT TIMELINE	Estimated Duration: 8 weeks (July – August)

Phase 1:  Planning and strategy
Phase 2:  Develop action plans
Phase 3:  Create marketing assets
Phase 4:  Implementation

FRONT-END SUPPORT	As mentioned earlier in this outline, the original idea for this app was more involved than the current finished product. As there is still more functionality that can be added to this application, future support will include adding previously mentioned functionalities such as the ability to export data and stats, deeper stat tracking, and updates to the user interface. 
BACK-END SUPPORT	Currently as the project is being presented, there is not much on the back end to support, the current state of the app is mostly front-end. That said, as more functionalities are added to the application such as the ability to save and restore scores and stats and the ability to export data are added, more back0end support will be needed. 
FUNCTIONALITY	Current:
•	Add home score.
•	Minus from home score.
•	Add to away score.
•	Minus from away score.
DESIGN	The design, like many aspects of this application, has changed as the project has progressed. The initial design included plans for functionalities that were not added, but eventually will be. While the current design speaks to and focuses on simplicity and the functionalities built into the application.
